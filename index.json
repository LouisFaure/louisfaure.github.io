Numerous constraints (multiple projects, thesis writing, pressure to publish, etc.) often lead many to write simple implementations of a given function, at the expense of efficiency. This is problematic as such code is not scalable, which can limit further discoveries done by other researchers. In this article, I will look at all tasks performed by a specific Python function I have designed, showing first an example of slow code, and then a suggestion of a faster implementation. I hope this will provide some tips to you to perform a scalable, more efficient, and environmentally friendly science!\nThe Task During my research, I was assigned to implement a relatively simple function. We work with single-cell data that includes clonal barcodes. These barcodes allow us to group and identify cells that belong to the same lineage, as a barcode would be passed from the mother cell to all subsequent daughter cells. Clonal barcoding is a potent tool for studying early fate biasing and can be used as input for some tools to infer the fate of non-barcoded neighboring cells.\nThe most basic fate bias estimation between two fates in barcoded cells consists of counting the occurrences of the fates in each clone. We then compare these occurrences to the ones of other fates to statistically assign a fate bias.\nMore precisely, we will calculate the fate bias $f$ as follows: $$ f = \\frac{c_A}{c_A+{c_B}\\times{\\alpha}^{-1}} $$ with $c_A$ and $c_B$ being the number of occurrences of our fates A and B in each clone, and $\\alpha= \\frac{\\sum c_A}{\\sum c_B}$ is the ratio of the sum of all observed clones for each fate.\nTo test of significance of fate bias, we will perform a Fisher exact test, with a 2x2 contingency table:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{|c|c|} \\hline c_A \u0026 c_B \\\\ \\hline \\sum c_A \u0026 \\sum c_B \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{align*} $$ While this task should not be compute-intensive, there are several good examples of slow and inefficient code that can be fixed. You will see that slowness is not only caused by slow calculation but also by data access!\nThe system used for benchmark The numbers showed here come from tests with my MacBook Pro M2P 32GB.\nI used python 3.10.13 and installed the following packages:\npip install cospar fast_fisher Loading libraries and the data import cospar as cs import warnings import scanpy as sc import numpy as np import pandas as pd import time sc.set_figure_params() warnings.filterwarnings(\u0026#39;ignore\u0026#39;) Quick overview of the data The data we will use here is a 30k+ cells dataset of mouse hematopoiesis. The cells were clonally barcoded once and then were subsequently sampled at multiple time points.\nadata_orig = cs.datasets.hematopoiesis() We will focus on the bifurcation between Monocytes and Neutrophils:\nmask = adata_orig.obs.state_info.isin([\u0026#34;Monocyte\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Neutrophil\u0026#34;]) | adata_orig.obs.NeuMon_mask adata = adata_orig[mask].copy() sc.pl.embedding(adata,color=\u0026#34;state_info\u0026#34;,basis=\u0026#34;emb\u0026#34;) Some parameters needed clone = \u0026#39;X_clone\u0026#39; # key to access the clonal matrix fA = \u0026#39;Neutrophil\u0026#39; # fate A fB = \u0026#39;Monocyte\u0026#39; # fate B state_key = \u0026#39;state_info\u0026#39; # key for fate assignments cutoff = 0.01 # cutoff for Fisher test corrected p-values Getting cell indices for each clone We use a clone matrix saved in anndata under obsm as a sparse matrix, where the rows are cells and columns are clones. We need to extract which cell belongs to which clone. In other words, the task is to retrieve the row indices of each column.\ndef get_cellid_per_clone(adata,clone): X_clone = adata.obsm[clone] return [np.argwhere(X_clone[:,i])[:,0] for i in range(X_clone.shape[1])] start = time.time() cid = get_cellid_per_clone(adata,clone) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 0.756s Why is this method slow? Though this approach is straightforward (practically one line), a for loop that calls np.argwhere for each of the columns implies that we are not leveraging NumPy\u0026rsquo;s ability to perform operations on entire arrays at once.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at a faster implementation:\ndef get_cellid_per_clone_f(adata,clone): X_clone = adata.obsm[clone] # Extract and sort row and columns rows, cols = np.nonzero(X_clone) sort_idx = np.argsort(cols) rows_sorted = rows[sort_idx] cols_sorted = cols[sort_idx] # Get the count of unique columns _, counts = np.unique(cols_sorted, return_counts=True) # Split rows_sorted based on counts return np.split(rows_sorted, np.cumsum(counts[:-1])) start = time.time() cid = get_cellid_per_clone_f(adata,clone) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 0.00539s Why is this fast? Because we use NumPy\u0026rsquo;s vectorized function np.nonzero to find the indices of non-zero elements in the entire array at once. Then, we sort these indices based on the column indices and split them into separate arrays for each column. By sorting the indices based on the column indices (np.argsort is also vectorized), the function avoids having to access the columns individually.\nGetting the occurrence of our two fate labels in each clone We want to count the occurrence of our two fate labels in each clone and the total of each fate. This involves retrieving the cluster assignment for each cell within each clone.\ndef get_counts_per_clone(adata,cid,state_key): # Convert cell id to assigned cell state for each clone cl = [adata[c].obs[state_key] for c in cid] # Count occurences of states per clone clA = np.array([(c==fA).sum() for c in cl]) clB = np.array([(c==fB).sum() for c in cl]) clAsum, clBsum = np.sum(clA) , np.sum(clB) return clA, clB, clAsum, clBsum start = time.time() clA, clB, clAsum, clBsum = get_counts_per_clone(adata,cid,state_key) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 1.71s Why is this slow? Here the issue lies in the repeated access of the anndata object in a for loop, which is quite inefficient. Also, although this does not have that much of an impact, the function calculates the sum of clA and clB separately.\nHere is a faster implementation:\ndef get_counts_per_clone_f(adata,cid,state_key): # Get cell id and clone id array i = np.repeat(np.arange(len(cid)), [len(c) for c in cid]) c = np.concatenate(cid) cid_cl = np.column_stack((c, i)) # apply cell/clone id array to states array df = adata.obs[[state_key]] df[\u0026#34;clone\u0026#34;]=np.nan df.iloc[cid_cl[:,0],1]=cid_cl[:,1] # Count occurences of states per clone cnts = df.groupby(state_key).value_counts([\u0026#34;clone\u0026#34;]) clAB = pd.concat([cnts[fA].sort_index(),cnts[fB].sort_index()],axis=1).values clA, clB = clAB[:,0], clAB[:,1] clAsum, clBsum = clAB.sum(axis=0) return clA, clB, clAsum, clBsum start = time.time() clA, clB, clAsum, clBsum = get_counts_per_clone_f(adata,cid,state_key) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 0.0103s Why is this fast? First, we used vectorized functions np.column_stack and np.repeat to create a NumPy array assigning each cell index to a clone id. Then, we use the groupby method from pandas, which is optimized for grouping and aggregating data. Finally, the anndata is read and written only once, avoiding the usage of any for loop.\nCalculating fate bias and its significance per cell We will use the equation mentioned in the introduction, as well as the Fisher exact test. More precisely, we will perform the test on each clone using extracted counts of our two fates and their total sum.\ndef get_fate_bias(clA,clB,clAsum, clBsum): # Perform Fisher extact test on clone counts from scipy.stats import fisher_exact pvals = [fisher_exact(np.array([[cla,clb], [clAsum, clBsum]]))[1] for cla,clb in zip(clA,clB)] # Get fate biasing using clone counts slope = clAsum/clBsum fate_bias = clA/ (clA + clB/slope) return pvals, slope, fate_bias start = time.time() pvals, slope, fate_bias = get_fate_bias(clA,clB,clAsum, clBsum) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 1.17s Why is this slow? Because scipy implementation of fisher_exact is written in plain Python. As this is the actual calculation part of our code, there should be room for improvement by using a faster implementation:\ndef get_fate_bias_f(clA,clB,clAsum, clBsum): # Perform Fisher extact test on clone counts from fast_fisher import fast_fisher_exact pvals = [fast_fisher_exact(cla,clb, clAsum, clBsum) for cla,clb in zip(clA,clB)] # Get fate biasing using clone counts slope = clAsum/clBsum fate_bias = clA/ (clA + clB/slope) return pvals, slope, fate_bias start = time.time() pvals, slope, fate_bias = get_fate_bias_f(clA,clB,clAsum, clBsum) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 0.0154s Why is this fast? With a simple Google search, I found the Python package fast_fisher, which provides Numba and Python implementations of the Fisher exact test. Numba compiles a function using the LLVM compiler library, while Cython converts Python functions to compiled C code, both lead to great speedups.\nSaving the data One might think that saving data is a trivial task. Here is how to avoid inefficiencies!\ndef assign_results(adata,cid,pvals,fate_bias,cutoff): adata.obs[\u0026#34;fisher_pval\u0026#34;] = np.nan adata.obs[\u0026#34;fate_bias\u0026#34;] = 0.5 for ci,p,f in zip(cid,pvals,fate_bias): adata.obs.loc[adata.obs_names[ci],\u0026#39;fisher_pval\u0026#39;]=p if p \u0026lt; cutoff: adata.obs.loc[adata.obs_names[ci],\u0026#39;fate_bias\u0026#39;]=f start = time.time() assign_results(adata,cid,pvals,fate_bias,cutoff) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 0.38s Why is this slow? The function locates the index of the dataframe using adata.obs_names[ci] and assigns the values. This operation is not very efficient as it involves looking up the index for each element. In addition, loc is slow as the cell id needs to be converted into integer indexes.\ndef assign_results_f(adata,cid,pvals,fate_bias,cutoff): adata.obs[\u0026#34;fisher_pval\u0026#34;] = np.nan adata.obs[\u0026#34;fate_bias\u0026#34;] = 0.5 c = np.concatenate(cid) # prepare assignment array cid_len = np.array([len(c) for c in cid]) cid_pval_f = np.column_stack(( c, np.repeat(pvals, cid_len), np.repeat(fate_bias, cid_len) )) # assign values to anndata col = adata.obs.columns adata.obs.iloc[cid_pval_f[:,0],col==\u0026#34;fisher_pval\u0026#34;] = cid_pval_f[:,1] cid_pval_f = cid_pval_f[cid_pval_f[:,1]\u0026lt;cutoff,:] adata.obs.iloc[cid_pval_f[:,0].astype(int),col==\u0026#34;fate_bias\u0026#34;] = cid_pval_f[:,2] start = time.time() assign_results_f(adata,cid,pvals,fate_bias,cutoff) end = time.time() print(f\u0026#39;{(end-start):.3}s\u0026#39;) 0.00429s Why is this fast? We prepare the assignment array outside the loop, which reduces the computational overhead. This assignment array is created by vectorized functions np.repeat and np.column_stack. To perform the actual assignment, we use iloc for indexing, which is faster than loc because it accesses the data directly by integer index. Lastly, we use boolean indexing (cid_pval_f[:,1]\u0026lt;cutoff) to filter the data, which is more efficient than using a loop.\nOverall speed comparison def slow_implementation( adata, clone = \u0026#39;X_clone\u0026#39;, fA = \u0026#39;Neutrophil\u0026#39;, fB = \u0026#39;Monocyte\u0026#39;, state_key = \u0026#39;state_info\u0026#39;, cutoff = 0.01): cid = get_cellid_per_clone(adata,clone) clA, clB, clAsum, clBsum = get_counts_per_clone(adata,cid,state_key) pvals, slope, fate_bias = get_fate_bias(clA,clB,clAsum, clBsum) assign_results(adata,cid,pvals,fate_bias,cutoff) def fast_implementation( adata, clone = \u0026#39;X_clone\u0026#39;, fA = \u0026#39;Neutrophil\u0026#39;, fB = \u0026#39;Monocyte\u0026#39;, state_key = \u0026#39;state_info\u0026#39;, cutoff = 0.01): cid = get_cellid_per_clone_f(adata,clone) clA, clB, clAsum, clBsum = get_counts_per_clone_f(adata,cid,state_key) pvals, slope, fate_bias = get_fate_bias_f(clA,clB,clAsum, clBsum) assign_results_f(adata,cid,pvals,fate_bias,cutoff) start = time.time() slow_implementation(adata) end = time.time() slow_t = (end-start) fate_bias_slow = adata.obs.fate_bias.copy() pvals_slow = adata.obs.fisher_pval.copy() start = time.time() fast_implementation(adata) end = time.time() fast_t=(end-start) fate_bias_fast = adata.obs.fate_bias.copy() pvals_fast = adata.obs.fisher_pval.copy() print(f\u0026#39;{(slow_t/fast_t):.4}X speed improvement!\u0026#39;) 243.6X speed improvement! We achieved more than a 200X speed improvement! That is quite an accomplishment. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the slower code benefited from the fast SSD of my MacBook. I would anticipate it running much slower on a system/HPC with slower storage.\nChecking consistency between two approaches It is always important to check that we end up with the same result between the two implementations!\nnp.array_equal(fate_bias_slow,fate_bias_fast) True # Using allclose because of slight numerical differences # between python and C implementations np.allclose(pvals_fast,pvals_slow) True Displaying results Let\u0026rsquo;s display our extracted fate biases\nsc.pl.embedding(adata[(adata.obs.fate_bias-.5).abs().sort_values().index], color=\u0026#34;fate_bias\u0026#34;,basis=\u0026#34;emb\u0026#34;,sort_order=False,cmap=\u0026#39;bwr\u0026#39;) Take home messages for efficient code writing and sharing Before attempting to parallelize every possible for loop, try to vectorize your code as much as possible. Numpy provides a wide range of fast functions for this purpose. Be mindful of data read/write and indexing, especially on slower HDD systems. Sometimes, pre-allocating data arrays and/or sorting indexes can be beneficial strategies. For actual computations occurring on large datasets, use Numba or Cython implementations whenever possible. Writing in Numba is particularly straightforward as its syntax is identical to Python\u0026rsquo;s. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to explore the web or ask some LLMs. There\u0026rsquo;s a good chance someone has already implemented a particular subfunction you need! Identify the slow parts of your code by profiling the runtime line by line. A simple and effective tool for this task is line_profiler. However, there\u0026rsquo;s an important caveat:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste your time optimizing a code/function that isn\u0026rsquo;t expected to be used frequently by you or other people. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to assess where our time is best invested!

Thus, individual polyps integrate via complex liquid dynamics on the surface and inside the colony.","tags":["phd"],"title":"Surface flow for colonial integration in reef-building corals","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Page: / ","date":1646388e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646388e3,"objectID":"2aad7cb714ad1355c470aa57a7f21dc0","permalink":"https://louis.faure.dev/talk/embl/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/embl/","section":"talk","summary":"Introduction to trajectory inference techniques.","tags":[],"title":"EMBL-EBI lecture: Introduction to trajectory inference techniques","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Petitpré C.","Louis Faure","Uhl P.","Fontanet P.","Filova I.","Pavlinkova G.","Adameyko I.","Hadjab S.","Lallemend F."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"127d0b8f94f10da71a2f82c75ab39b72","permalink":"https://louis.faure.dev/publication/petitpre2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/petitpre2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Different types of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are essential for auditory perception by transmitting complex auditory information from hair cells (HCs) to the brain. Here, we use deep, single cell transcriptomics to study the molecular mechanisms that govern their identity and organization in mice. We identify a core set of temporally patterned genes and gene regulatory networks that may contribute to the diversification of SGNs through sequential binary decisions and demonstrate a role for NEUROD1 in driving specification of a Ic-SGN phenotype. We also find that each trajectory of the decision tree is defined by initial co-expression of alternative subtype molecular controls followed by gradual shifts toward cell fate resolution. Finally, analysis of both developing SGN and HC types reveals cell-cell signaling potentially playing a role in the differentiation of SGNs. Our results indicate that SGN identities are drafted prior to birth and reveal molecular principles that shape their differentiation and will facilitate studies of their development, physiology, and dysfunction. This study chronicles dynamic gene expression in differentiating spiral ganglion neurons from murine embryonic day 14.5 to postnatal stage, establishes their lineage trajectories, and identifies molecular determinants of cell fate decision.","tags":["phd"],"title":"Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of the developing mouse inner ear identifies molecular logic of auditory neuron diversification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin A.","Micali G.","Louis Faure","Cosentino Lagomarsino M.","van Teeffelen S."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"f1aad512a73d7a04ccdd170ae99af581","permalink":"https://louis.faure.dev/publication/colin2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/colin2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Cells must control the cell cycle to ensure that key processes are brought to completion. In Escherichia coli, it is controversial whether cell division is tied to chromosome replication or to a replication-independent inter-division process. A recent model suggests instead that both processes may limit cell division with comparable odds in single cells. Here, we tested this possibility experimentally by monitoring single-cell division and replication over multiple generations at slow growth. We then perturbed cell width, causing an increase of the time between replication termination and division. As a consequence, replication became decreasingly limiting for cell division, while correlations between birth and division and between subsequent replication-initiation events were maintained. Our experiments support the hypothesis that both chromosome replication and a replication-independent inter-division process can limit cell division: the two processes have balanced contributions in non-perturbed cells, while our width perturbations increase the odds of the replication-independent process being limiting.","tags":["master"],"title":"Two different cell-cycle processes determine the timing of cell division in Escherichia coli","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kameneva P.","Artemov A.

Our results reveal transitions connecting the intermediate mesoderm and progenitors of organ primordia, the hematopoietic system and endothelial subtypes. Unexpectedly, by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we found that intra-adrenal sympathoblasts at that stage are directly derived from nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors, similarly to local chromaffin cells, whereas the majority of extra-adrenal sympathoblasts arise from the migratory neural crest.

Cementoblasts, the cells that produce the mineralized tissue, cementum, that is responsible for connecting the soft periodontal tissue to the tooth, are a key cell type for maintaining/restoring tissue attachment following disease. Here, we identify two distinct stem cell populations that contribute to cementoblast differentiation at different times. During postnatal development, cementoblasts are formed from perivascular-derived cells expressing CD90 and perivascular-associated cells that express Axin2. During adult homeostasis, only Wnt-responsive Axin2+ cells form cementoblasts but following experimental induction of periodontal disease, CD90+ cells become the main source of cementoblasts. We thus show that different populations of resident stem cells are mobilized at different times and during disease to generate precursors for cementoblast differentiation and thus provide an insight into the targeting cells resident cells for novel therapeutic approaches. The differentiation of these stem cells into cementoblasts is however inhibited by bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharides, emphasizing that regeneration of periodontal ligament soft tissue and restoration of attachment will require a multipronged approach.","tags":["phd"],"title":"Stem cell contributions to cementoblast differentiation in healthy periodontal ligament and periodontitis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Klimovich A.","Giacomello S.","Björklund A.","Louis Faure","Kaucka M.","Giez C.","Murillo-Rincon A.

In this study, we identified and functionally characterized prototypical ANO/SCN/TRPM ion channel-expressing pacemaker cells in the basal metazoan Hydra by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, immunochemistry, and functional experiments. Unexpectedly, these prototypical pacemaker neurons express a rich set of immune-related genes mediating their interaction with the microbial environment.

Here we present ElPiGraph, a scalable and robust method for constructing principal graphs. ElPiGraph exploits and further develops the concept of elastic energy, the topological graph grammar approach, and a gradient descent-like optimization of the graph topology. The method is able to withstand high levels of noise and is capable of approximating data point clouds via principal graph ensembles. This strategy can be used to estimate the statistical significance of complex data features and to summarize them into a single consensus principal graph.

In addition, our analysis identifies previously undetected early gene modules expressed long before fate determination although being clearly associated with defined sensory subtypes. Overall, the early diversity of sensory neurons is generated through successive bi-potential intermediates in which synchronization of relevant gene modules and concurrent repression of competing fate programs precede cell fate stabilization and final commitment.","tags":["phd"],"title":"Single cell RNA sequencing identifies early diversity of sensory neurons forming via bi-potential intermediates","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$ Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

We found that spontaneous DNA replication errors in proliferating cells arose more frequently in subpopulations experiencing endogenous stresses, such as problems with proteostasis, genome maintenance, and reactive oxidative species production. The presence of these subpopulations of phenotypic mutators is not expected to affect the average mutation frequency or to reduce the mean population fitness in a stable environment.
