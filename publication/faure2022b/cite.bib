 abstract = {Neuron types are the building blocks of the nervous system, and therefore, of functional circuits. Understanding the origin of neuronal diversity has always been an essential question in neuroscience and developmental biology. While knowledge on the molecular control of their diversification has largely increased during the last decades, it is now possible to reveal the dynamic mechanisms and the actual stepwise molecular changes occurring at single-cell level with the advent of single-cell omics technologies and analysis with high temporal resolution. Here, we focus on recent advances in the field and in technical and analytical tools that enable detailed insights into the emergence of neuron types in the central and peripheral nervous systems.},
