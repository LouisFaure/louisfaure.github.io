 abstract = {During embryonic development, nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) give rise to chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland via the bridge transient stage, according to recent functional experiments and single cell transcriptomics data from humans and mice. However, currently, existing data do not resolve the finest heterogeneity of developing chromaffin populations. Here we took advantage of deep SmartSeq2 transcriptomics sequencing to expand our collection of individual cells from developing murine sympatho-adrenal anlage and uncover the microheterogeneity of embryonic chromaffin cells and corresponding developmental paths. After improving our atlas of sympatho-adrenal development and performing experimental validations, we discovered that SCPs in the local nerve show high degree of microheterogeneity corresponding to early biases towards either Schwann or chromaffin terminal fates. Furthermore, we found that a post-bridge population of developing chromaffin cells gives rise to persisting immature chromaffin cells and the two terminal populations (adrenergic and noradrenergic) via diverging differentiation paths. Taken together, we provide a thorough identification of novel markers of adrenergic and noradrenergic populations in developing adrenal glands and report novel differentiation micro-paths leading to them.},
