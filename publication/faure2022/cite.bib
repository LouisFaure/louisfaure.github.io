 abstract = {scFates provides an extensive toolset for analysis of dynamic trajectories comprising tree learning, feature association testing, branch differential expression and with a focus on cell biasing and fate splits at the level of bifurcations. It is meant to be fully integrated into scanpy ecosystem for seamless analysis of trajectories from single cell data of various modalities (e.g. RNA, ATAC).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
